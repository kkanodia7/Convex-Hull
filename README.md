# Convex-Hull
Finds and displays the convex hull of a set of randomly generated points in a blank image using a Graham Scan.  
  
The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex shape that contains all points in that set.  
  
This program takes an input for the number of points to generate, randomly generates them in a 700x700 blank image, and uses a Graham Scan to find the convex hull.  
  
It prints the time the Graham Scan took and creates a ppm image file (in P3 format) of the points and the convex hull.
